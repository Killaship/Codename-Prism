# Codename-Prism
Prism is a basic shell coded in C, for Linux. 


As with all my projects, run `bash build.sh` to auto-build the program.

Also go to [this website](https://replit.com/@Killaship/Codename-Prism#src/shell.c) to run it in your browser. (helps when I'm not at home or with a Linux machine nearby.)

Important note: more often than not, the live main branch is filled with bugs and errors. For trying out the shell, clone the latest release. (Mostly tested to be bug free.)
